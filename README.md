# NLP_WebApplication
This is a web application of NLP tasks made with Django.  

The tasks include text generation, sentimental analysis, fill mask, machine translation, question answering and text summarization. HuggingFace is used for the pre-trained machine learning models used in the project.  

I usually use Heroku to host websites, but due to the enormous size of the dependencies (specifically TensorFlow and PyTorch), Heroku cannot be used to host this app. AWS EC2 and beanstalk could work, but I donâ€™t see the necessity to host this website considering the fees associated with running instances. So the application can only run locally for now. However, you can folk the repo and follow the steps to reproduce the web application and host it on AWS or other cloud platforms if you are interested.  

The functionality and screenshots of the web pages are shown as follows.
